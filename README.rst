About
=====

A standalone gallery which generates single galleries out of folders in the filesystem.
Config happens per gallery in a config file and with parameters you hand to the actions.

Uses some homemade MVC-stuff, so expect nothing to fancy...

The name is the spanish word for "to look at yourself" - most of the time, a gallery is a
look at yourself or your life, so while showing a gallery you really look at yourself.
